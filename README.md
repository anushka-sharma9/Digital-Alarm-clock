# Digital-Alarm-clock
This project is a simple digital alarm system built using C++. The user can input a specific alarm time, and when the current system time matches the set alarm time, the program triggers a beep sound as an alert. The project demonstrates the use of time manipulation and basic input/output operations in C++.
